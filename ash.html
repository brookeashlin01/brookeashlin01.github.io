        <p>
          Ash is an almost 5 year old <span class="gender">male</span>
          <span class="breed">Domestic Short Hair</span>
          with a mostly black body and a white nose bridge, mouth, neck,
          chest, and belly. These markings are commonly referred to as a
          "<span class="general">tuxedo</span>" color pattern. He also has what are
          adoringly called <span class="general">"socks"</span>--white markings that
          start at least halfway down his leg, all the way to the tip of his paw.
          The rest of him--his tail included--is solid black.

        <p>Ash was originally an ex's sister-in-law's (Kat) kitten from her cat's (Kota)
          most recent litter in January 2017. Ash was about 4 months old when I
          took him into my care. Kat and her daughter were living with my ex's
          grandparent's in their apartment and they were going to take him to the
          local NH Humane Society within the next week. My ex and I were looking
          for a kitten at the time and offered to take him. They all agreed that
          my ex and I could take Ash. His full name is <span id="fullname">Ash Ketchum</span>,
          and was named by my ex's niece since he was technically her kitten. I
          appreciated the Pokemon reference and kept the name <span id="fullname">
          Ash Ketchum</span>, calling him Ash for short.
