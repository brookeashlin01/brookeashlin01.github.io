        <p>
          Damian is a 4 year old <span class="gender">male</span>
          <span class="breed">Flame Point Siamese</span>.
          The nature of being a <span class="breed">Flame Point Siamese</span> means
          his body mostly consists of a lovely cream color. His face--starting from
          his nose and moving in an outward direction up his forehead--has a burst
          of apricot colored fur, which has traveled up to his ears, which are also
          apricot in color. Along with his little paws and his tail, which
          surprisingly has little rings of cream and apricot dispersed along the
          tail, giving him the appearance of what some say is
          "<span class="general">similar to that of a racoon tail</span>". Various
          gradient patches--of the same previously mentioned apricot colored fur--is
          sprawled out across his body.

        <p id="origin-damian-p">Damian was origianlly a feral kitten from a local feral colony in
          Gilford, NH. He was trapped at ~4 months old, and by the time I adopted
          him, he was ~6 months old. I brought him home and it took weeks for
          him to get used to being in a home and to get used to me, but eventually
          he bonded with me and enjoyed getting attention and recieving & giving
          affection. I call him my 'reformed feral kitty', since he is no longer
          truly feral. Damian's original name from the shelter was Hamilton, but
          I didn't like the name so I looked up Pokemon-related names and chose
          the name Damian because he was the original owner of Ash Ketchum's
          Charmander--I though of naming him charmander, because he was orange,
          but decided against the silly name and chose one loosely related to
          the color orange instead.
